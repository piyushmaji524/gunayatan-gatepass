# Hindi Translation Feature - Setup Instructions

## Overview

## What's New

- **Dual Language Display**: Both English and Hindi versions are shown side by side
- **Translation Caching**: Translations are cached to improve performance and reduce API calls

## Files Updated
1. `includes/translation_helper.php` - New translation helper functions
2. `security/verify_gatepass.php` - Added Hindi translations for item verification
3. `security/view_gatepass.php` - Added Hindi translations for item viewing
4. `security/verified_gatepasses.php` - Added Hindi translations for verified gatepasses
5. `security/translation_demo.php` - Demo page to test translation feature

## Key Features
- **translateToHindi()**: Core translation function with error handling
