# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Setup Guide

Your beautiful developer portfolio page has been created and uploaded! Now let's publish it using GitHub Pages.

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/piyushmaji524/gunayatan-gatepass
2. Click on **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/ (root)** or **/docs** (recommended)

## Step 2: Configure for docs folder (Recommended)

Since we put the developer page in the `docs/` folder:
1. In Pages settings, select **main** branch
2. Select **/docs** folder
3. Click **Save**

## Step 3: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
- This usually takes 1-3 minutes
